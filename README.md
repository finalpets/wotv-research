## Why the app have Ads?

The Main difference between other tools or websites, its because i need an API to manage the data for iOS/Android, i have my own VPS server in AWS (Amazon Web services) and i need to pay each month, the iOS Developer account is expensive compare to the Android, 100 USD for a year on Apple vs 25 USD for Life on Google, thats why i need to get back the investment sorry about that.
