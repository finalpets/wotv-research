# WOTV Research

Issue repository for Wotv Research APP (Android/iOS).

## Purpose

The purpose of this page is to act as an issue / feature tracker. No source is available here.

## How To

Click on the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/PokeNavBot/Issue-Tracker/issues) and search for an existing issue. Voting thumbs up on an issue will increase its priority and attention. Duplicates will eventually be closed. 

If the bug / issue you want to report doesn't exist, hit "New Issue" and select from the correct option. 

Be as detailed as you can and provide screenshots and any logs you may be able to gather from your device as they will greatly increase the time to a solution.
